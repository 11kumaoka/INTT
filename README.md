General macros for the INTT and the ladder classification macros are here.

## General Introductions

### How To Start
1. To get started, you should have your GitHub account (possible to download codes without the account, but why don't you have it?)
2. Join the organization "sPHENIX-Collaboration" by making asking Jin or Chris ( see https://wiki.bnl.gov/sPHENIX/index.php/Code_Repository#Initial_git_setup )
3. Join the team "INTT-Developpers" from https://github.com/orgs/sPHENIX-Collaboration/teams/intt-developers/members (fix me if it's wrong)
4. Fork this repository to your account (standard way in sPHENIX, possible to commit directly) by clicking the "Fork" button on the right top in this page.
5. You can edit the forked repository on your browser if you want.
6. You can also copy your forked repositry to your local environment by `git clone git@github.com:nukazuka/INTT.git` (in Genki's case).
  - There are some ways to clone a repository: https, ssh, and GitHub CLI.
  - https: the easiest way but
